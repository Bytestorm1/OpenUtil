# OpenUtil
A general-purpose bot to serve as an alternative to YAGPDB.xyz written in C#.

# But w h y ?
Well, its quite simple really. I saw this https://pastebin.com/dj4kN448 and decided "screw it, I'll make my own yagpdb." At that point I decided I'd go all the way and try to implement as many features from the 5 bots mentioned that I could. All open-source so server admins and members alike can be sure of the bot's security, and if they still feel uncomfortable, make their own.
The idea is not "ooh hurr durr look at my bot use my bot pls," its to make this accessible to everyone, without worries about data mining and ads.

# Can I help?
Of course you can! This is github! We also have a discord if you want to discuss the bot (or my other projects, if I had any) at https://discord.gg/kEgRWXE
