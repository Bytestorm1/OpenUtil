# OpenUtil
An open source all-around utility bot for server admins worried about privacy. 

# Can I take this code and make a version specific to my server?
Yes, that's part of the reason this is open-source. The only extra setup required is creating a Tokens.cs file to hold the bot token and whatnot.
